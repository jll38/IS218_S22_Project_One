                <h1>What is Git?</h1>
                <p>
                <strong>Git</strong> is a free and open source version control system
                designed to help manage projects big or small. It has become standard
                in the industry, used by over <strong>73 million developers</strong>.
                Github is one of the main ways to track code repositories and branches,
                making code readily accessible to be pulled or cloned.<br/>If you wish
                    to have a clone of this project on your device, you could type
                    in the following command into any command line that supports git.<br/>
                    <samp>git clone https://github.com/jll38/IS218_S22_Project_One</samp>
            </p>

              <h2>Version Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Version Control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to source code over time.
                    Every file in the repository has a complete long-term changelog that can span years.
                    Many developers utilize Github as a way to store their code repositories.

    <div class="row">

                <h1>Commits</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Commits</strong> are essentially a snapshot of a project's current
                    changes/structure. Commits are usually followed by a "push" to the source
                    code repository by the developer. This is a big part of version control
                    and allows us to upload our most up-to-date version of a project easily,
                    along with keeping track of it's history.

                </p>

              <h2>Branches</h2>
                <p>
                    Branches are essentially a pointer to a snapshot of your changes made.
                    They are essentially independent lines of development.
                    An example of a good use of branching is when you're working on new
                    features or bug fixes. It isolates your work from that of other team members,
                    Your branches and the branches of your team members could then be merged
                    back into the main project.
